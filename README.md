# Bus-Tracker
Bus-Tracker will track the location of all the buses around MIT and Harvard.

### Pre-requisites 📋

_Before you start using it, you have to create your account at [Mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com)
Follow the process and get you personal token and replace the X in line 28 with it._

```
mapboxgl.accessToken = ' XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX ';
```

## How to use it :rocket:
Load the page and it automatically will show you a dropdown menu with all the buses available at that time. Choose one of them and wait at most 15 seconds later it will appear a target icon which will move according the position of the chosen bus.
